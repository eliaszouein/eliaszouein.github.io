Scouting was introduced in Lebanon by two teachers, Abdul Satar and Mohammad Abdul Jabbar Khairy who received support 
from Toufik El Hibri. They came to Lebanon from England in 1912 and established the first Scout troop in the school owned 
by El Hibri, where they worked. This troop had lots of activities, later including a trip to Istanbul, Ottoman Empire, where 
they met with Sultan Mehmed V. Members of this troop played an important role in spreading the Scouting and Guiding movement
 in Lebanon and other countries.

During the Lebanese civil war, Scouts from all associations played an important role in helping civilians, distributing food, 
medicine, and other forms of aid to refugees. Some Scouting associations formed first aid groups that helped the wounded.
 Scouts also participated in peace campaigns to help put an end to that war. During the war, Scouts from all sides of the conflict 
remained brothers and remained in contact with each other, manifesting a good example of unity for all Lebanese. 
All this added to the reputation of Scouting in Lebanon, with Lebanese people tending to respect Scouts and many parents encouraging 
their children to join the movement.

Today, years after the end of the civil war, Scouting in Lebanon still faces great tasks, with Lebanon being involved in large
 reconstruction plans aimed to erase effects of the war and to enable it to regain its advanced role in the region and the world.
[citation needed] The role of the Scouts include promoting peace and unity through campaigns and summer camps for youth and children.
