Daisy

Daisy, Daisy, we honor your memory true.
We are Girl Scouts all because of you.
We follow the path you started, 
And live the law you charted.
We grow and grow, for Juliette Low,
America's proud of you.

All Girl Scouts

I don't know but I'be been told,
All Girl Scouts are good as gold.
I am one and I say it's true,
Scouting's great for me and you.

Sound off: 1, 2,
Sound off: 3,4,
Bring it on down: 1,2, 3, 4
1,2,- 3,4.

Daisy's have a disc of blue,
They are Scouts that are brand new.
They are cute and they are sweet,
Daisy Scouts are fun to meet.

Brownies have a disc of green,
They are second on the scene,
They wear a uniform that's brown,
Their smile song can erase a frown .

Junior level is the next,
A yellow disk is on their vest,
They say that camping is big fun,
And they earn badges one by one.

Cadettes are teens that care a lot,
Their service projects hit the spot,
white disc is the one they wear,
The name Girl Scouts they're proud to wear.

Senior's disc are red, I know,
They are Girl Scouts on the go,
With Wider Opportunities,
Some Girl Scouts go overseas.

Leaders have no disc at all,
They come all sizes, big and small,
They share their time and talents too,
They make Girl Scouting great for you.

Girl Scouts Together

Girl scouts together that is our song
Winding the old trails, rocky and long
Learning our motto, living our creed
Girl scouts together in every good deed.

Girl scouts together happy are we
Friendly to neighbors far o're the sea
Faithful to country loyal to home
Girl scouts together wherever we roam.

Girl scouts together onward we go
Joining as sisters stronger we grow
Mothers and lawyers, women in space
We know no boundaries, the future's our place.
