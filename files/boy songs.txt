Akela's Trail

It's a world of fun, it's a world of joy,
And a smile comes easy to every boy.
Things that we've learned today,
Lead along Akela's way.
We are Cub Scouts after all.

Chorus:
We are Cub Scouts after all,
To all Cub Scouts send the call.
Show Akela we stand tall,
We are Cub Scouts after all.
When we seek our quest, we will do our best,
On Akela's trail, we will never fail.
Without any doubt's,
We will be loyal Scouts.
We are Cub Scouts after all.

Chorus

I Am a Cub Scout

I am a Cub Scout 
And a very happy boy. 
With a uniform of blue and gold 
And a den that gives me joy. 
I am a Cub Scout 
Earning badges one by one 
I do my best and I meet the test 
A god citizen I've become. 
I help out other people when 
I see they need a lot. 
I do my chores around the house 
And I feed my dog named spot. 
I am a Cub Scout 
Doing my duty willingly. 
Someday I'll join a boy scout troop 
And a fine man I will be.

Coast to Coast

(Repeat all lines)

From coast to coast
Boy/Girl Scouts are the most
I said from coast to coast
Boy/Girl Scouts are the most

Chorus (air guitar):
Na-na na-na na na
Na-na na-na na na na
Na-na na-na na-na na
Na-na na-na na na na

From east to west
Boy/Girl Scouts are the best
I said from east to west
Boy/Girl Scouts are the best

From north to south
Girl/Boy Scouts have big mouths
I said from north to south
Girl/Boy Scouts have big mouths

For the Boy Scouts version, say the Girl Scouts have big mouths. For the Girl Scouts version, say the Boy Scouts have big mouths.

Take Me Out to the Scout Camp

Take me out to the scout camp,
Take me out with my Troop,
Buy me some goodies and leathercrafts,
I don't care if I ever get back,
For it's swim, shoot, climb with the camp staff
If they're not trained it's a shame 
For it's 1, 2, 3 miles you hike at the old scout camp
